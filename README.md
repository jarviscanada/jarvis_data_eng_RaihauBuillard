**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_RaihauBuillard/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented data collection scripts using Bash to execute Linux commands, automating hardware and resource data retrieval. Configured PostgreSQL database within a Docker container to store collected data centrally. Created and managed Docker containers to ensure consistent and isolated database environments. Integrated the system with Git for version control and collaboration. Integrated Crontab scheduling for automated data collection (host_usage.sh), ensuring continuous updates of CPU and memory usage metrics. Deployed the Linux Cluster Monitoring Project, automating real-time hardware resource monitoring.


## Highlighted Projects
**Web application for Ski Acro Québec**: Evaluated client needs and defined tasks for a given period. Distributed tasks within the team and orchestrated daily meetings to monitor progress during iterations. Conceptualized the collected data to establish a foundational system that aligns with client needs (class diagram, sequence diagram, deployment diagram). Implemented microservices in a .NET environment to design a flexible platform. Designed an API to process all essential requests for platform operation. Managed data efficiently with Entity Framework within SQLite as well as MSSQL.

**Github metric application**: Set up a series of tasks in the 'Issues' section on GitHub and defined various 'Labels' to categorize each task. Created a project on GitHub using the Kanban methodology and ensured each task is positioned correctly within the Kanban board's columns. Configured actions in GitHub to automate the pipeline. Extracted project metrics from GitHub using GitHub's GraphQL API. Used the Hangfire library to schedule requests regularly. Stored the collected data in a NoSQL database such as MongoDB.
